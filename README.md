## Overview
Productivity Pro Suite is an all-in-one Chrome extension designed to streamline your daily workflow and keep you in a state of flow. We believe that essential tools shouldn't force you to leave your work. This extension bundles a website timer, a smart task scheduler, and an AI-powered document summarizer directly into your browser, available on any webpage with a single click.

Our solution is better than a separate website or app because it eliminates the need for context switching. You can summarize a lengthy news article or set a focus timer for a research task without ever leaving the page. This seamless integration provides instant utility, saves time, and keeps you focused on what matters most.

## ‚ú® Key Features
‚è∞ Website Timer: Set a focus timer for any website. When time is up, the tab closes automatically, and you get an option to easily restore the tab if you need more time.

üìÖ Smart Task Scheduler: Schedule your tasks and meetings with optional links. It fully integrates with your Google Calendar, automatically syncing events to keep you organized.

‚úçÔ∏è AI-Powered Summarizer: Instantly get a concise summary of any webpage or article using the power of the Gemini API. Perfect for quick research and absorbing key information.

## üöÄ Installation and Setup

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration
For the Summarizer and Google Calendar Sync features to work, you must configure two things:

### 1. Gemini API Key
You need a free API key from Google AI Studio to power the summarizer.

Go to Google AI Studio to get your key.

Open the background.js file.

Replace the placeholder text "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY" with your actual key.

JavaScript

// in background.js
const GEMINI_API_KEY = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"; // <-- PASTE YOUR KEY HERE
### 2. Google OAuth 2.0 Client ID
To sync with Google Calendar, the extension needs a Client ID.

Follow the instructions on the Chrome Developers Guide to create one.

Open the manifest.json file.

Replace the existing client_id with your own.

JSON

// in manifest.json
"oauth2": {
  "client_id": "YOUR_OWN_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com", // <-- PASTE YOUR ID HERE
  "scopes": [
    "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events",
    "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents"
  ]
}
